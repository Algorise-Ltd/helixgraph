# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Problem and Context
Enterprise data is highly siloed across departments such as Marketing, Procurement, and HR, making cross-domain queries and analytics difficult.  
Analysts spend excessive time integrating data manually, slowing decision-making and reducing business agility.  
We need a unified, semantically consistent knowledge layer that connects data across domains.

---

## 2. Goals (What Success Looks Like)
- Establish a foundational ontology covering Marketing, eCommerce, Procurement, Logistics, and HR domains.  
- Build a Neo4j knowledge graph populated with synthetic but realistic data (about 2,000 nodes).  
- Enable basic cross-domain queries through Cypher.  
- Produce clear documentation including schema and data dictionary.

---

## 3. Non-Goals (For Focus)
- No production or real customer data will be used.  
- No user interface or visualization dashboards in this sprint.  
- No integration with external APIs or systems yet.

---

## 4. Personas (Who Benefits)
**Data Scientists:** gain integrated data access for analytics and modeling.  
**Business Analysts:** perform cross-domain insights without manual joins.  
**IT and Data Engineering Teams:** streamline ETL and metadata governance.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Ontology maturity | 0.9 (production-ready with minor refinements) |
| Data volume | 2,000 nodes and 5,000 relationships in Neo4j |
| ETL automation | Pipeline runs end-to-end without manual steps |
| Data quality | Less than 2% validation errors |
| Documentation | 100% of entities and relationships documented |

---

## 6. Scope (What We Will Build in MVP)
- Core ontology design for three domains: Marketing, Procurement, and HR.  
- Neo4j database instance with synthetic data.  
- ETL pipeline with automated quality checks.  
- Documentation including schema diagram and data dictionary.

---

## 7. Data Protection
- All data will be synthetically generated (no real or sensitive data).  
- Project follows internal data governance and security guidelines.  
- Access restricted to the project team only.

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigations (Top 3)
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|
| Overly complex ontology | Use modular domain-level ontologies |
| Data inconsistency | Implement automated validation checks |
| Misalignment across teams | Conduct weekly ontology review sessions |

---

## 9. Glossary (Plain Language)
**Ontology:** Semantic model defining entities, relationships, and attributes.  
**Node:** A data entity such as an employee, vendor, or product.  
**Relationship:** The connection between nodes such as “works in” or “purchases from.”  
**Synthetic Data:** Artificially generated but realistic dataset used for testing.

---

## 10. Acceptance in Sprint 0
- PRD document completed and reviewed.  
- Neo4j environment initialized.  
- Ontology design approved by all domain leads.  
- Pull request merged and task marked “Done” in Linear.
